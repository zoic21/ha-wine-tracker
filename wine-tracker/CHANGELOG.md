# Changelog

## 1.4.0

- **AI Sommelier chat** — ask your personal sommelier for food pairings, serving temperatures, or bottle recommendations — it knows every wine in your cellar and responds in your language
- **Multi-provider chat** — works with Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama (same providers as label recognition)
- **Markdown responses** — the sommelier formats answers with bold text, lists, and headings for easy reading
- **Session persistence** — chat history survives page navigation via sessionStorage, so you can switch between cellar and stats without losing the conversation
- **Chat in header navigation** — clean ghost icon next to settings instead of a floating bubble
- **Scroll lock** — background stays put while the chat panel is open
- **Style guide** — new `STYLE_GUIDE.md` documents all UI decisions (colors, radii, spacing, typography)
- **CSS consistency pass** — theme-aware hovers, standardized border-radii, and element sizing across all components
- **121 tests** — 10 new tests covering chat endpoint, history validation, provider errors, and wine context building

## 1.3.1

- **Inline stats editing** — click any wine in the statistics page (tooltip links, best rated, price overview, recently added) to open the edit modal right there — no more navigating away to the cellar
- **Wine API endpoint** — new `/api/wine/<id>` endpoint returns full wine data as JSON, powering the inline edit on stats
- **Clickable chart tooltips** — tooltip wine names are now links that open the edit modal directly
- **Shared modal code** — extracted duplicated HTML into Jinja partials (`_settings_modal`, `_wine_form_fields`) and shared JS into `wine-modal.js`, eliminating ~380 lines of duplicated code
- **Shimmer loading for images** — wine card images now show a diagonal shimmer animation while loading, with a smooth fade-in once ready; shimmer color adapts to your active theme
- **Fix highlight stacking** — editing multiple wines in a row no longer leaves all of them glowing; only the most recently saved card gets highlighted
- **Fix tooltip over modal on mobile** — chart tooltips now hide when opening the edit modal, so they don't float over the form
- **111 tests** — 8 new tests covering the wine API endpoint, stats modal presence, tooltip links, and edit parameter handling

## 1.3.0

- **103 tests** — new tests for path traversal, SSRF protection, and disallowed file extensions

## 1.2.1

- **Fix drink window color on duplicate/add/edit** — drink window badges now show the correct color (green/orange/red) immediately after AJAX operations instead of requiring a page reload
- **Fix bottle format on duplicate** — duplicating a wine with a non-standard bottle size no longer silently resets to 0.75L
